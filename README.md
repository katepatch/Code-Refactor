# Code Refactor Starter Code

## User Story

AS A marketing agency</br>
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards</br>
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

## Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards</br>
WHEN I view the source code</br>
THEN I find semantic HTML elements</br>
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements</br>
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning</br>
WHEN I view the image elements</br>
THEN I find accessible alt attributes</br>
WHEN I view the heading attributes</br>
THEN they fall in sequential order</br>
WHEN I view the title element</br>
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Notes
Here is my submission for the Module 1 challenge.
Given the criteria I did my best to make this page accessible and to make sure the heading attributes fell in order.  I also tried to give the HTML elements structure.
